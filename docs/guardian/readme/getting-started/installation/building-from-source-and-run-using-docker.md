# ðŸ”¨ Building from source and run using Docker

The following steps need to be executed in order to start Guardian using docker:

1. Clone the repo
2. Configure project level .env file
3. Update BC access variables
4. Setup IPFS
5. Build and launch with Docker
6. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Here the steps description follows, for other practical examples go to 
* [Steps to deploy Guardian using a specific Environment( DEVELOP)](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/readme/getting-started/examples/steps-to-deploy-guardian-using-a-specific-environment-develop)
* [Steps to deploy Guardian using a specific Environment ( QA)](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/readme/getting-started/examples/steps-to-deploy-guardian-using-a-specific-environment-QA)
* [Steps to deploy Guardian using default Environment](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/readme/getting-started/examples/steps-to-deploy-guardian-using-default-environment) 

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian.git
```

2. Configure project level .env file
The main configuration files that needs to be provided to the Guardian system are the ".env" file.
Cut and past the **.env.template** renaming it as **.env** here you may choose the name of the Guardian platform. Leave the field empty or unspecified if you update a production environment to keep previous data (for more details read at https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/readme/environments/ecosystem-environments)
   
   for this example pourpose let's name the Guardian platform as "develop"

    ```shell
      GUARDIAN_ENV="develop"
    ```

3. Update the following files with your Hedera Testnet account info (see prerequisites) as indicated. Please check complete steps to generate Operation_ID and Operator_Key by looking at link: [How to Create Operator_ID and Operator_Key](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/getting-started/getting-started/how-to-create-operator-id-and-operator-key). 

The Operation_ID and Operator_Key are all what Guardian needs to access the Hedera Blockchain assuming a role on it. This parameters needs to be configured in a file at the path "guardian/configs" the file should use the following naming convention: 

   * guardian/configs/.env.\<GUARDIAN_ENV\>.guardian.system

There will be other steps in the Demo Usage Guide that will be required for the generation of Operator_ID and Operator_Key. It is important to mention that the Operator_ID and Operator_Key in the ```guardian/configs/.env.\<GUARDIAN_ENV\>.guardian.system``` will be used to generate demo accounts.

   For example:
 
   following the previous example the file ```/configs/.env.develop.guardian.system``` is already provided in the folder as example, update the variables OPERATOR_ID and OPERATOR_KEY in this file.

   ```plaintext
   OPERATOR_ID="..."
   OPERATOR_KEY="..."
   ```
   {% hint style="info" %}
   **Note**. You can use the Schema Topic ID (`INITIALIZATION_TOPIC_ID`) already present in the configuration files, or you can specify your own.
   {% endhint %}

   {% hint style="info" %}
   **Note** for any other GUARDIAN_ENV name of your choice just copy and past the file ```/configs/.env.template.guardian.system``` and rename as ```/configs/.env.<choosen name>.guardian.system```
   {% endhint %}

4\. Now, we have two options to setup IPFS node : 1. Local node 2. IPFS Web3Storage node.

#### 4.1 Setting up IPFS Local node:

4.1.1 We need to install and configure any IPFS node.

For example: [https://github.com/yeasy/docker-ipfs](https://github.com/yeasy/docker-ipfs)

4.1.2 For setup IPFS local node you need to set variables in `./guardian/configs/.env.develop.guardian.system`

```
IPFS_NODE_ADDRESS="..." # Default IPFS_NODE_ADDRESS="http://localhost:5002"
IPFS_PUBLIC_GATEWAY='...' # Default IPFS_PUBLIC_GATEWAY='https://localhost:8080/ipfs/${cid}'
IPFS_PROVIDER="local"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

1. Default IPFS\_NODE\_ADDRESS="[http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002/)"
2. Default IPFS\_PUBLIC\_GATEWAY="[https://localhost:8080/ipfs/${cid}](https://localhost:8080/ipfs/$%7Bcid%7D)"
{% endhint %}

#### 4.2 Setting up IPFS Web3Storage node:

4.2.1 For setup IPFS web3storage node you need to set variables in `./guardian/configs/.env.develop.guardian.system`:

```
IPFS_STORAGE_API_KEY="..."
IPFS_PROVIDER="web3storage"
```

To generate Web3.Storage API KEY. Please follow the steps from [https://web3.storage/docs/#quickstart](https://web3.storage/docs/#quickstart) to obtain it. To know complete information on generating API Key please check : [how-to-generate-web3.storage-api-key.md](../../../../getting-started/getting-started/how-to-generate-web3.storage-api-key.md "mention")

5\. Build and launch with Docker. Make sure you use Docker Compose V2 (comes with Docker Desktop > 3.6.0) as at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/. Please note that this build is meant to be used in production and will not contain any debug information. From the project's root folder:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

About docker-compose: from the end of June 2023 Compose V1 wonâ€™t be supported anymore and will be removed from all Docker Desktop versions. Make sure you use Docker Compose V2 (comes with Docker Desktop > 3.6.0) as at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
{% endhint %}

6\. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and complete the setup. To get more info, please check: [Launching Guardian](broken-reference/)

### Troubleshoot

#### To delete all the Docker Containers

```
docker builder prune --all
```

#### To run by cleaning Docker Cache

```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```
