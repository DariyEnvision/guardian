## ---- January 2024----

### Implement discontinuing policy workflow

Implement the policy deprecation workflow which includes:

* Guardian UI allowing issuing SR to discontinue a policy (version) or the entire policy from a certain date (in the future or 'now').
* Policy grid should display a suitable marker against non-active policies, and a different for the ones soon expiring.
* An appropriate message posted in the corresponding Hedera topic recording the 'discontinuing' decision
* For in-progress projects that have been registered and are operating under the policy it should be possible to 'switch' to the appropriate version of the policy which is still valid.

### Gold Standardâ€™s Carbon Sequestration through Accelerated Carbonation of Concrete Aggregate Webinar

* Design schemas for the Carbon Sequestration through Accelerated Carbonation of Concrete Aggregate methodology, create a PowerPoint presentation, and conduct webinar.
* Development of the policy using the schemas and workflow designed

### Business User Policy Development Feature

Business Analyst and Sustainability Consultants generally are less technical than developers. Although JSON is the most functional way to construct Guardian Policies, there may be more formal ways to integrate traditional business tool and rules validation capabilities to automatically compile policies.

### Geographic raster imagery support in Guardian

Introduce support for getTIFF and other raster types of data.

### Post-minting data enrichment for issued tokens

Projects should have ability to enrich the trust-chain of tokens with additional data in the form of VC/VP after the tokens have been created through editable metadata. Diagrammatically this should look like this:

```scss
VP1(VC1, VC2) <---- Token
                  /
VP2(VC3) <-------/ (edited) 
```

Where VP2 (VC3) have been linked to the token after the token have been minted.

It should be possible to specify, at minting time, that a particular token instance prohibits adding and/or removing of any information after the creation.

Probably depends on [https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/discussions/607](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/discussions/607), also visible here: [https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-657](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-657)

## ---- February 2024----

### Support externally controlled DIDs with keys in Guardian

Introduce a workflow into the Guardian where a DID Controller would introduce a dedicated verification method into the main DID for which the private key would be stored and managed by a Guardian instance. This way Guardian would only be able to control the specific verification method's key, but not the rest of the DID.

### Mitigation Credits Research

Introduce the ability to mint Mitigation Asset Type tokens as the result of the calculation of the diff between planned (and reported on the ESG) and actual results of the calculations based on the MRV data for a reporting period. This would likely require:

* New type of blocks in the policy definition language specifying 'target' numbers.
* Policy Engine ability to mint different types of tokens depending on the conditions
* Needs to be linked with [GHG scorecards Research #1017](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1017) logic

## ---- March 2024----

### Remove requirement for hardcoded (error prone) status options

The ability to define states and to link it to a type, perhaps been able to link a button or UI to a set of states. There should be warnings for modifying, a state label or title within the UI, whereby it makes it harder for an asset to be identified. In addition, the validation check should ensure that the correct states have been selected for button objects or other like-UI, to reduce the time and frustration hardcoding different states.

In short, standardising all state options for all policies -- perhaps having a new type of button that is linked to a custom state list/enum sat with drop-down links could be the way to go.

The states could be anything, but the goal would be to be standardised throughout all policies:

* approved
* rejected
* etc

While this is good for the demand side of value extraction. This is highly beneficial for the creator of policies as you could select the correct value from a state-list drop down instead of having to hardcode all state options for button, selection or filters for approved or rejected states.

## ---- April 2024----

### Full project data comparison as produced/captured by policies

Introduce a comparison functionality where it'd be possible to 'diff' arbitrary sections or the entire trust-chains for different tokens, potentially issued by different policies such that the system would:

* graphically display the differences where a user would then be able to 'scroll' through and review them in the UI
* get a numerical 'similarity score' indicating how similar the two 'chains' are

### Revamp Guardian user/roles and permissions model

* Fundamentally separate the concept of users, roles and permissions in Guardian
* Introduce granular concept of permissions which could be assigned to users, a user could then perform a specific function within the role if its assigned role 'contains' this permission. These should include (but not limited to):
  * Policy edit/submit for review
  * Policy view
  * Policy approval & publish
* Introduce a "user admin" role, which allows:
  * defining new roles from permissions
  * assigning of roles to users
* Create a permissioning system which verifies actor role before any action has been taken throughout Guardian
* Package in suitable most-common role set into Guardian so it can be operated immediately 'out of the box' without the need for additional configuration
* Create a concept of 'delegation' where a user with a particular role/permission can explicitly 'delegate' this role/permission to another user
* Introduce the functionality to produce a report (page, download) which lists all users and their roles/permissions mapping in the system

### Hedera interactions resilience module

Create a Guardian 'transaction execution' service which would assure orderly transaction execution and their status tracking, and provide intelligent retry and failure recovery functionality such that required transactions would be guaranteed to be asynchronously executed once, and only once, and in the right order.

### Scaling Guardian to enterprise workloads

* make necessary changes to Guardian and document hardware (DevOps) configuration such that deployed instances would satisfy performance parameters specified in the 'acceptance criteria' section below.
* review and where needed revamp FE<->BE communication (i.e. FE updates are too frequent and thus too taxing on BE, they need to be better batched and sent together)
* potentially introduce caching in FE, between FE and BE, and possibly between BE and the DB and/or Hedera & IPFS (for examples there are cases when immutable documents, schemas, etc which don't change there are unecessarily reloaded or resent)
* implement memory usage optimisation, potentially in-memory compression to make sure the services don't blow up the RAM of the cloud "hardware"
* Prove with practical testing that Guardian can fulfil acceptance criteria requirements below

## ---- May 2024----

### Conform Guardian generated NFTs with HIP412 for better ecosystem-wide compatibility for NFTs and wallets

1. Define senisble defaults for all NFT Guardian assets that is the minimum implementation of HIP412 ([@mattsmithies](https://github.com/mattsmithies) can advise on tooling or a method to support)
2. Move the generated of the current metadata to the _"properties"_ field of the [HIP412 Specification](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-412#specification)
3. Allow marketplaces to change the defaults for their specific needs on the creation of tokens and more importantly the mint of assets.

### Further evolution of policy comparison (a.k.a 'mass diff')

Relying on the work done in the course of [#1793](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1793) (i.e. creating data structures (hashes) to enable more efficient comparison), allow for mass-comparison of policies such that a user should be able to search for local policies 'similar' to 'different' to some other policy based on some similarity threshold. This is related (but different) to [#2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) as it focuses on 'easy diff' vs 'easy search'.

### Allow users chose sync/async execution of an API call

Introduce a way for the client (API using) applications to specify that a particular API call should be executed synchronously. Enable such calls to return extended information about the call results since more information is available after the chain has been executed (for example 'message ID' of the document published in IPFS).

## Global environmental/Guardian data search (indexer) component for Hedera and IPFS

* Improve the data storage and indexing capabilities of Guardian for the data belonging to the local instance such that complex analytical queries could be run efficiently, such as 'search for data similar to this' and 'what is the possibility of this being a double entry for something submitted elsewhere'.
* Introduce a global search and indexing capability for data produce by other (all) instances such that queries above could be run on the entire body of Guardian data produced from the beginning of time (in blockchain sense).
* Extend [Block and policy discoverability/search #2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) for users to be able to preview the usage of the block without having to import "other SR's" policy into their Guardian instance
