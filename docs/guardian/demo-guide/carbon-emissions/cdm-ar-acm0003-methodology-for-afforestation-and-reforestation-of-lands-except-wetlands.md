# üè≠ CDM AR-ACM0003: Methodology for Afforestation and Reforestation of Lands Except Wetlands

## Policy Description:

The CDM AR-ACM0003 methodology is a comprehensive framework developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to guide afforestation and reforestation projects aimed at combating climate change and promoting sustainable land use practices. This methodology facilitates the identification of suitable project sites, establishes baselines for measuring greenhouse gas emissions, ensures the additionality of emissions reductions, implements robust monitoring and reporting systems, addresses leakage and permanence concerns, and seeks validation and certification from accredited entities. By adhering to this methodology, projects can effectively sequester carbon dioxide, conserve biodiversity, provide ecosystem services, and generate socio-economic co-benefits, contributing to global climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals.

The Guardian policy for afforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands (AR-ACM0003) incorporates schemas for project details, baseline scenario GHG removals, project scenario GHG removals, project scenario emissions, and leakage. These schemas provide a structured framework for site selection, emissions quantification, and monitoring procedures.

## Workflow Description:

The workflow for the afforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands (AR-ACM0003) Guardian policy involves the Project Proponent preparing and submitting the project description, which is then reviewed and approved by the Designated National Authority (DNA). The UNFCCC Secretariat adds the approved project to the project pipeline and registry. The Project Proponent conducts monitoring and submits the monitoring report to the Designated Operational Entity (VVB) for assessment and validation. Upon certification by the VVB, the UNFCCC Secretariat reviews the project and issues Certified Emission Reductions (CERs).

The primary objective of AMS-I.A. is to provide a structured and standardized approach for small-scale renewable electricity generation projects by the user. It aims to facilitate the displacement of GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications by enabling the production of electricity using various renewable energy technologies.&#x20;

The scope of this methodology includes renewable electricity generation units like solar photovoltaic, hydro, wind, and renewable biomass that supply electricity to individual households/users or groups of households/users. It is applicable to various situations, including new installations (greenfield) or replacements of existing onsite fossil-fuel-fired generation, ensuring versatility and adaptability to different project needs and conditions. &#x20;
