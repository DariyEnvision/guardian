## **Policy Description**:

The Gold Standard Afforestation and Reforestation (AR) methodology is a set of guidelines and procedures developed by The Gold Standard Foundation for quantifying and verifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions resulting from afforestation and reforestation projects. The methodology provides a standardized framework for calculating the carbon sequestration potential of these types of projects, taking into account removals from both aboveground and belowground tree biomass, and also quantifies emissions from biomass burning for site preparation and the use of nitrogen fertilizer.

The AR methodology sets out requirements for project design, implementation, and monitoring. It outlines the steps necessary to establish a baseline for GHG emissions and carbon sequestration potential, and to assess the project's impact on local biodiversity. The methodology also includes provisions for addressing potential leakage and permanence risks, which can impact the long-term effectiveness of the project in sequestering carbon.

The Gold Standard AR methodology promotes sustainable land use practices that contribute to mitigating climate change while supporting the conservation of biodiversity. By providing a standardized framework for evaluating and verifying the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation and reforestation projects, the methodology helps to incentivize the adoption of more sustainable land use practices around the world.

## Policy Guide

Typically, the way we start the demonstration is by logging in as a Standard Registry.&#x20;

Create a Standard Registry user if you haven't done so already.

You'll now be prompted to configure your Standard Registry account. Go through the user profile setup screen. At the last step of the user profile screen, Standard Registry users will need to fill out the Standard Registry attribute form (see screenshot below). Press Connect when finished. This will now initialize the Guardian instance on the correct Hedera Consensus Service Topics, create a DID document, create a Verifiable Credential, etc.

Now we will be creating the Policy. Click on the "Policies" tab and select "Policies." We have two ways to create policies.&#x20;

For this demo guide, we will use the "Import from Open Source" way. Click on that button and find the policy for this guide and click on the import button.

Once the policy is imported successfully, you get two options: Publish and Dry Run mode. We select the Dry Run option and select Go.

Create additional users by clicking the ‚ÄúCreate User‚Äù button.

Once the users have been created go to each one and assign the appropriate role (i.e. Project Proponent, VVB, Technical Advisory Committee and NGO Supporters).

Go to the Standard Registry profile and approve the VVB in the ‚ÄúApprove VVB‚Äù tab.

Click on the Project Proponent profile and select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù.
