## Policy Guide

Typically, the way we start the demonstration is by logging in as a Standard Registry.&#x20;

Create a Standard Registry user if you haven't done so already.

You'll now be prompted to configure your Standard Registry account. Go through the user profile setup screen. At the last step of the user profile screen, Standard Registry users will need to fill out the Standard Registry attribute form (see screenshot below). Press Connect when finished. This will now initialize the Guardian instance on the correct Hedera Consensus Service Topics, create a DID document, create a Verifiable Credential, etc.

Now we will be creating the Policy. Click on the "Policies" tab and select "Policies." We have two ways to create policies.&#x20;

For this demo guide, we will use the "Import from Open Source" way. Click on that button and find the policy for this guide and click on the import button.

Once the policy is imported successfully, you get two options: Publish and Dry Run mode. We select the Dry Run option and select Go.

Create additional users by clicking the ‚ÄúCreate User‚Äù button.

Once the users have been created go to each one and assign the appropriate role (i.e. Project Proponent and VVB).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (37) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Go to the Standard Registry profile and approve the VVB in the ‚ÄúApprove VVB‚Äù tab.

Click on the Project Proponent profile and select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now, we can input all the project details and data associated with the project in the ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù form. In the schema Excel file, if the final CRU calculations do not result in a positive integer, selecting "Ok" after completing the form will trigger errors.

To proceed with the flow, the next step is to access the Standard Registry profile and include the project in the project pipeline. This can be achieved by navigating to the "Project Pipeline" tab and selecting the "Add" option.

Next, proceed to the Project Proponent profile and locate the "Projects" section. Then, click on the downward arrow and assign the VVB to the project.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (72).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After successfully assigning the VVB to the project, the next step is to access the VVB profile and click on the "validate" option located in the Projects tab.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Navigate back to the Project Proponent profile to complete the monitoring report. In the Projects tab select ‚ÄúAdd Report‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (104).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Upon selecting "Add Report", a file will open containing the project details and schemas previously filled out. Here, you can update the information based on the relevant monitoring plan provided by the methodology. After updating the information and including a project area map, you may click on "Ok" to proceed.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have completed the monitoring report, please access the VVB profile and go to the monitoring reports tab. Here, you will find a "Verify" button - select that to proceed.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (75).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is the final step in the workflow. Access the Standard Registry profile and navigate to the "Monitoring Reports" tab. Here, you will find a "Mint" button - select that to mint the tokens for this monitoring period.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By accessing the "Token History" tab, you can view the number of tokens that have been minted. Additionally, clicking on the "View TrustChain" button will allow you to view the TrustChain.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Trust Chain view presents critical elements that are publicly available for discovery, such as token information, policy information, and all the necessary details concerning the Verifiable Credentials comprising the Verifiable Presentation. On the bottom of the screen, you will find "Cards" showcasing the Verifiable Credentials in chronological order.
