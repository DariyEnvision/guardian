# Mobile operation for the Standard Registry

### **Creation of a new account**

The first adaptation relates to the redesign of the creation of new accounts. This redesign for mobile solves the overflow previously present while still maintaining the descriptions.

Here the images below show the selection of account type and selection of username and password in order to create a new account.

The header was also adapted for mobile for all types of users. The balance was maintained as one of the elements always present. The new header for mobile, these elements are always present.

The various menus and submenus (in case there are any) have been moved upon clicking on the hamburger menu, presenting the user with the following.

Also some information about the user is also presented, such as the name of the user (in this case "user1234") and his respective Hedera ID and HBar balance.
