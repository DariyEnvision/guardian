# KrypC CarbonCore Policy – Global Carbon Council

### KRYPC CARBONCORE GUARDIAN POLICIES 

The purpose of this document is to policy for renewable power generation project using Global Carbon Council Methodology. KrypC CarbonCore platform will use the GCCM0001 methodology to create the policy for tokenization of the carbon credit via Hedera Hashgraph technology. 
The policy facilitates the project owners of eligible greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction projects to calculate emission reduction of their projects, monitor the emission reductions and develop the project submission in accordance with the methodologies.

The policy refers to the methodology for renewable power generation projects, which either supply power to the connected grid or to recipient captive user for captive consumption (here onwards referred as “the project activity”) facilitates the projects that displace the electricity which would be provided to the grid by more emission-intensive mix of power sources, than that established under project activity. The power generated from the Renewable sources can be either directly sold to the grid or used for captive consumption or can be stored in a Battery storage solution (BESS) attached to renewable energy generation plant and then delivered to the grid or used for captive consumption.

### SPECIFICATIONS

This Policy can be used for renewable power generation projects, which either supply power to the connected grid or to recipient captive user for captive consumption (here onwards referred as “the project activity”) facilitates the projects that displace the electricity which would be provided to the grid by more emission-intensive mix of power sources, than that established under project activity. 

The source of the methodology for the policy is taken from Global Carbon Council (GCC) methodology number GCCM0001 - Methodology for Renewable Energy Generation Projects Supplying Electricity to Grid or Captive Consumers. We will use updated versions of the documentation as and when they are released through the GCC.

### POLICIES

The policy is based on following baseline and monitoring methodologies of CDM/GCC. 

•	ACM0002: Grid connected electricity generation from renewable sources; and 

•	AMS-I-D: Grid connected renewable electricity generation. 

•	AMS I F: Renewable energy generation for Captive use and mini grid

The policy also refers to the latest approved versions of the following tools and guidelines of CDM/GCC:

a)	“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” 

b)	“Tool to calculate baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation”. 

c)	“Tool for Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality” 

**Baseline emissions**

Baseline emissions include only CO2 emissions from electricity generation in power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The policy refers to the methodology that assumes that all project electricity generation above baseline levels would have been generated by existing grid connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants. The baseline emissions are to be calculated as follows:

**BEy = EG BL,y × EFCO2,y**

**EFCO2,y = EF grid,CM,y**

**Project Emissions** 

Under this policy we assume that most renewable energy project activities, project emissions are equal to zero

**PEy = 0**

**Leakage Emissions**

As per methodology used in this policy, no leakage emissions are anticipated

**LEy = 0**

**Estimation of emission reductions**

As per policy referred from section 12 of GCCM001 V3.0, the formula to calculate the emission reductions is

**ERY=BEY-PEY-LEY**

### UNDERSTAND KRYPC'S CARBONCORE FROM A HIGH-LEVEL

KrypC CarbonCore platform provide solution for all parties simplifying the entire process making Carbon trading market safe, reliable, efficient, convenient, open and inclusive. It acts as ledger for creating the trust chain for the verified carbon units and verified emission reductions created. The platform also help in verifying and minting carbon offset tokens will lend its credibility towards 'high-quality' credits, attracting higher price and allows more funding to projects. 

KrypC CarbonCore Platform tokenized the carbon credits via Hedera Hashgraph technology. This will follow a few detailed steps:

•	Create specific architecture and libraries for the Project listing process and documentation for various registries

•	Create MRVs, architecture, and libraries for carbon project listing processes and documentation on Hedera

•	Tokenize and mint tons of carbon offsets (tC02e)

•	Complete the build with KrypC’s carbon solution platform as a ledger for creating the trust chain for the VCUs/VERs created by any stakeholder/partner

•	Recognizes different VERs/VCUs of by virtue of running a ‘pricing matrix’ of different ‘series of tokenized VERs/VCUs with the aim of having strong liquidity available

•	Link to KrypC's Carbon solution for a full end-to-end platform for tokenized VCUs/VERs

**The overall following flow will be followed by KrypC CarbonCore:**
