[IREC](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Methodology%20Library/iREC)

**Description**: 

This policy supports the tokenization of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in accordance with the I-REC Standard, and specifically, the I-REC(E) Product Code. The I-REC Standard is a non-profit organization that provides an attribute tracking standard that can be used around the world. While the I-REC Standard is designed to track attributes for a diversity of products, Product Codes provide additional requitements for specific products and markets. The I-REC(E) Product Code provides requirements for electricity products, and was developed by Evident, who acts as Code Manager and Registry Operator. The schema and workflow of this policy were designed to reflect the MRV requirements, processes, and roles outlined by both I-REC Standard and the I-REC(E) Product Code.

[Verra](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Methodology%20Library/Verra/Verra%20Redd/VM0007)

**Description**: 

This policy supports the tokenization of carbon offsets, specifically Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) in accordance with Verra’s Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), and specifically, the VM0007 REDD+ Methodology Framework (REDD+ MF). Verra develops and manages standards that are globally applicable and advance action across a wide range of sectors and activities. The VCS Program is the world’s most widely used voluntary GHG program.

[Remote Workflow](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Methodology%20Library/GHG%20Methodology/Remote%20WorkFlow%20Policy)

**Description**: 

This policy supports the estimation, calculation, and tokenization of GHG emissions resulting from remote work. This policy can be used as a stand-alone methodology, or a methodology to estimate organizational Scope 3 GHG emissions from remote work to be incorporated into organizational GHG inventories in alignment the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and/or the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard. To support integration with the GHG Protocol Policies, both location and market-based emissions are calculated.
