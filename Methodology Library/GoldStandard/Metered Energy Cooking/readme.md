**Introduction**

According to [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/our-story/sector-community-based-energy-efficiency) more than 3 billion people lack access to clean cooking solutions leading to over 4 million premature deaths each year. This doesn't attribute the havoc GHG emissions from wood or fossil fuel based cookstoves are going to cause in the future.

According to the 2021 State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets report by Ecosystem Marketplace, improved cookstoves were the second most popular project type in the voluntary carbon market in 2020, accounting for 13% of all carbon offsets transacted. In 2020, cookstove projects generated over 13 million carbon offsets, with an estimated value of $48.6 million USD. The report notes that cookstove projects continue to be popular due to their multiple co-benefits, including improved health outcomes, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced deforestation.

This Guardian Policy tokenizes the VER(verified emission reduction) after verifying emissions reductions from improved cookstove projects according to Gold standard's methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices (ME&ED). The methodology is based on the use of energy meters and temperature sensors to collect data on the energy consumption and thermal efficiency of cookstoves, which is then used to calculate the emissions reductions achieved.

**Why ME&ED(Metered and Measured Energy) Methodology**

Carbon offsets from improved cookstove projects help advance Sustainable Development Goals 13 (climate), 7 (energy), 5 (gender), and 3 (health). However, for the carbon offsets generated from these projects to be considered legitimate, methodologies must provide accurate or conservative measurements of the climate impact of these projects.

Recently, a striking [report](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) by The Guardian (media group) exposed the flaws in Verra's REDD+ scheme leading them to [phase out](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/10/biggest-carbon-credit-certifier-replace-rainforest-offsets-scheme-verra-aoe) their methodologies. Such exposures dwindle the stakeholder's sentiment in the carbon markets and hence it is extremely important to build and choose right methodology for carbon projects.

There are a bunch of improved cookstove methodologies to choose from - [GS-TPDDTEC](https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/407-ee-ics-technologies-and-practices-to-displace-decentrilized-thermal-energy-tpddtec-consumption/), [GS-Simplified](https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/408-ee-ics-simplified-methodology-for-efficient-cookstoves/), [CDM-AMS-II-G](https://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/DB/GNFWB3Y6GM4WPXFRR2SXKS9XR908IO), [CDM-AMS-I-E](https://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/DB/JB9J7XDIJ3298CLGZ1279ZMB2Y4NPQ) and the recently released [GS-Metered-Energy](https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/news-methodology-for-metered-measured-energy-cooking-devices/) methodology. According to a new [research](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-2606020/v1/c2e6a772-b013-49f9-9fc4-8d7d82d4bebc.pdf?c=1678869691) from scholars of University of California, Berkeley - Gold Standardâ€™s Metered and Measured methodology, which directly monitors fuel use, is most aligned with the estimates (only 1.3 times over-credited) and is best suited for fuel switching projects which provide the most abatement potential and health benefit.

This approach is more precise than traditional methodologies, which rely on more generalized assumptions or estimates to calculate emissions reductions. It also places a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement and the inclusion of local communities in the project development and monitoring process. This approach promotes greater transparency and accountability and helps to ensure that the environmental and social benefits of the project are maximized. This Guardian policy, is a reflection of same methodology according to the Gold standard's typical project lifecycle.
