## Introduction

CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) Methodology AMS-II.J, titled "Demand-side activities for efficient lighting technologies," falls under Scope 2 of the CDM framework. This methodology is designed to encourage and support energy efficiency by promoting the use of energy-efficient light bulbs, particularly self-ballasted Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs), in residential applications. 

The primary goal of AMS-II.J is to reduce electricity consumption by replacing less energy-efficient baseline lamps with new, energy-efficient project lamps. These project lamps must be self-ballasted CFLs with integrated ballasts as non-removable components. It's important to note that project lamps used in this methodology should be entirely new and not transferred from other activities or sources. 

To ensure that the project effectively contributes to energy efficiency, certain requirements must be met. The total light output of the project lamp must be equal to or greater than that of the baseline lamp being replaced. The determination of light output for both baseline and project lamps should adhere to relevant national or international standards, or alternatively, the minimum light output values provided in Table 2 of the methodology may be used. 

CDM Methodology AMS-II.J offers a structured approach to promoting energy efficiency in residential lighting, which can lead to reduced electricity consumption and environmental benefits. This methodology provides a framework for projects aimed at making the transition to energy-efficient lighting technologies, contributing to sustainable development and greenhouse gas emission reductions. 

## Need and Use for the AMS-II.J Policy

Residential lighting constitutes a significant portion of global electricity consumption, contributing to both emissions and high energy costs. Mitigating climate change, enhancing energy security, and achieving economic savings all hinge on the transition to energy-efficient lighting. This methodology serves the need to reduce residential energy waste and emissions. 

AMS-II.J provides a clear project development framework, emphasizing the replacement of less energy-efficient baseline lamps with integrated ballast self-ballasted Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs). This promotes energy-efficient lighting, reduces emissions, and enhances sustainable development. It also enforces adherence to relevant standards for quality assurance and simplifies monitoring and verification processes. In essence, CDM Methodology AMS-II.J aligns the need for energy efficiency with a structured approach that fosters a more sustainable and environmentally responsible approach to residential lighting. 

## Objective and Scope

The objective of CDM Methodology AMS-II.J is to promote energy efficiency in residential lighting by incentivizing the replacement of less energy-efficient baseline lamps with self-ballasted Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) featuring integrated ballasts. This methodology seeks to reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease residential electricity costs, ultimately contributing to global climate change mitigation and economic savings. The scope of this methodology encompasses residential applications, emphasizing the replacement of baseline lamps with new, energy-efficient project lamps, while adhering to specific light output requirements as defined by relevant national or international standards.   

## Methodology Overview

CDM Methodology AMS-II.J, titled "Demand-side activities for efficient lighting technologies," offers a systematic approach to address the imperative need for enhanced energy efficiency in residential lighting. This methodology focuses on the replacement of less energy-efficient baseline lamps with self-ballasted Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) that are equipped with integrated ballasts, serving as non-removable components. The central objective of this methodology is to curtail energy consumption, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce residential electricity costs. In summary, CDM Methodology AMS-II.J is a targeted approach that enables the adoption of energy-efficient residential lighting technologies, ultimately contributing to sustainable development, reduced emissions, and economic savings, while adhering to stringent quality and standardization criteria.  

## Typical Projects

Projects eligible under CDM Methodology AMS-II.J encompass a variety of initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency in residential lighting. Typical projects within the scope of this methodology include residential lighting upgrades, energy-efficient lighting programs, government-led lighting projects, lighting retrofits, public housing initiatives, and technology standardization and certification efforts. 

## Available Roles

Project Participant - The project Participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project Participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions. 

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration. 

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.
