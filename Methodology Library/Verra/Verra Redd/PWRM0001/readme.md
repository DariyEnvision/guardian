## Introduction

The Plastic Waste Reduction Methodology (PWRM0001) serves as a structured framework providing guidelines and procedures for estimating and quantifying additional plastic waste removed or diverted from the environment. Its focus lies in both informal and formal activities geared towards preventing plastic waste from persisting or ending up in the environment. PWRM0001 offers a systematic approach to assess the effectiveness of plastic waste collection activities while emphasizing their crucial role in curbing environmental pollution.

In response to the global crisis of plastic waste pollution, PWRM0001 addresses this environmental challenge. It outlines comprehensive measures to quantify plastic waste removal or diversion through both formalized sectors under governmental supervision and informal sectors involved in recycling or waste management activities. By defining specific criteria and methodologies, PWRM0001 aims to foster accountable and transparent practices in handling plastic waste, aligning with sustainable waste management goals and environmental preservation endeavors.


## Need and Use for the PWRM0001 Policy

Plastic waste has become an escalating environmental crisis, with staggering quantities of non-biodegradable materials inundating our ecosystems. In contemporary society, the proliferation of single-use plastics and inadequate recycling infrastructure has exacerbated this issue, resulting in extensive pollution across land, waterways, and oceans. The ubiquity of plastic waste poses significant ecological and health hazards, threatening wildlife, marine habitats, and ultimately, human well-being.

The rapid proliferation of plastic waste in modern lifestyles presents an imminent threat to the environment. The durability of plastics, combined with their usage in packaging, consumer goods, and various industries, has led to an unprecedented accumulation in our ecosystems. This unbridled rise in plastic waste has transformed once-pristine landscapes into waste repositories, with plastics persisting for centuries, breaking down into microplastics that infiltrate food chains and contaminate vital ecosystems.

The need for methodologies like PWRM0001 arises from the urgency to mitigate the adverse impacts of plastic waste. This methodology offers a structured approach to quantify the additional plastic waste removed or diverted from the environment, fostering accountability and transparency in waste management efforts. By delineating guidelines for formal and informal waste collection activities, PWRM0001 encourages robust practices that not only alleviate plastic pollution but also contribute to building resilient and sustainable waste management systems.

Considering escalating environmental concerns and the imperative to safeguard our ecosystems, PWRM0001 plays a pivotal role. It offers a standardized framework that empowers stakeholders to measure and assess their contributions in curbing plastic waste pollution. By providing a systematic methodology for quantifying plastic waste reduction efforts, PWRM0001 serves as a channel for informed decision-making, fostering collaborations and initiatives aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of plastic waste on our environment and society.

## Available Roles

Project Proponent - The project proponent is responsible for executing the waste reduction project. The project proponent must adhere to the requirements outlined by Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard and provide evidence of the waste collection achieved. Upon successful verification, the project proponent receives Waste Collection Credits (WCC) as an incentive for their waste reductions.

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project's waste reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.

Registry (Verra) – With Verra as the registry they take on responsibilities that encompass project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project descriptions and monitoring reports. This process ensures that waste reduction projects meet the highest standards before tokens are issued.


## Key Documents & Schemas

1.	Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline waste collection, project waste collection, etc.

2.	Plastic Waste Collection – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual project plastic waste collection.

3.	Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.
